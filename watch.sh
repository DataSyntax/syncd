# Inotify script to trigger a command on file changes.
#
# The script triggers the command as soon as a file event occurs. Events
# occurring during command execution are aggregated and trigger a single command
# execution only.
#
# Usage example: Trigger rsync for synchronizing file changes.
# ./watch.sh rsync -Cra --out-format='[%t]--%n' --delete SOURCE TARGET
#
# ./watch.sh rsync -Cra --out-format='[%t]--%n' --include core \
#  --WATCH_EXCLUDE=sites/default/files --delete ../web/ vagrant@d8.local:/var/www
